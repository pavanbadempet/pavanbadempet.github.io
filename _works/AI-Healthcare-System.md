**AI Healthcare System: AI-Powered Medical Insights**

A production-grade healthcare platform that combines **Machine Learning** for disease prediction with **Generative AI** for intelligent medical assistance. Built with a modern microservices architecture, the system provides preliminary health assessments for multiple conditions while maintaining strict data privacy.

### Tech Stack
*   **AI/ML:** XGBoost, Gemini Pro (GenAI), Gemini Vision, FAISS (Vector DB)
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, JWT Auth
*   **Frontend:** Streamlit
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, Render (Backend), Streamlit Cloud (Frontend)

### Key Features
*   **Multi-Disease Prediction:** Specialized models for Diabetes, Heart Disease, Liver Disease, Kidney Disease, and Lung Cancer.
*   **RAG-Based Medical Assistant:** Uses Gemini Pro and FAISS to provide context-aware responses grounded in medical data, minimizing hallucinations.
*   **Smart Lab Report Analyzer:** Utilizes Gemini Vision to extract and analyze data from PDF/Image lab reports automatically.
*   **Secure Architecture:** Microservices design with tenant isolation and secure session management.
