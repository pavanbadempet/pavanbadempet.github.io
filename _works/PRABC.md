Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, accounting for 14% of all cancers in Indian women. About 90% of breast cancer patients live for at least 5 years after the cancer is diagnosed. When the breast cancer is detected early, the chance of survival is much higher. So, we are developing a tool for Calculating the Risk of Attaining Breast Cancer. The tool is supposedly going to help women understand their Risk of Attaining Breast Cancer and leading to understanding the special need of care.

Key Features:

* The tool utilizes advanced data insights derived from BRCA data and machine learning techniques, employing a random forest model as a classifier.
* Performance evaluation involves fine-tuning precision and recall metrics.
* Informatic applications will be available for mobile phones, Windows, and MacOS systems, facilitating accessibility to risk assessment.
* Ongoing efforts extend beyond risk assessment to include daily lifestyle changes for breast cancer prevention.
* Long-term aspirations include leveraging data imaging for enhanced diagnostics and analysis, with the ultimate goal of eradicating breast cancer fatalities.
