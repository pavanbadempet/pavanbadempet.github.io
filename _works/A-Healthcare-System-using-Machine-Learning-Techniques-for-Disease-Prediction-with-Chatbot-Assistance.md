**AIO Healthcare System: AI-Powered Medical Insights**

A production-grade, microservices-ready platform designed to democratize access to preliminary medical insights. It combines Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost) for disease prediction with Generative AI (Gemini Pro & RAG) for personalized, context-aware medical consultation.

### Tech Stack
*   **AI/ML:** XGBoost, Gemini Pro, RAG Architecture, LangChain
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python
*   **Frontend:** Streamlit
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, VectorDB (Chroma/Pinecone), PostgreSQL

### Key Features
*   **Multi-Disease Prediction:** High-accuracy classifiers for Diabetes, Heart, and Liver diseases.
*   **Context-Aware AI Chatbot:** Uses RAG to recall past checkups and lab reports, preventing hallucinations.
*   **Automated Lab Analysis:** Vision API extracts values from PDF/Image lab reports to update health profiles.
*   **Security:** Enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication and tenant isolation.
