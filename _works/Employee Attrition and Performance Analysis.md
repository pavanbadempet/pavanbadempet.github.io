In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations face a significant challenge of retaining their employees. Employee Attrition, which refers to the loss of employees over time, is a critical issue that can have a significant impact on an organization's productivity, profitability, and overall success. To ensure optimal employee productivity and quality of delivery, it is essential to have an effective employee performance management system in place. With the advent of Data Science and analytics, organizations can now leverage their vast amounts of data to gain insights into employee attrition and take corrective action. In this context, this background highlights the importance of employee performance management and the role of Data Science and analytics in analyzing relevant datasets to gain insights into employee attrition.

The workflow involved in analyzing the dataset and identifying driving factors related to analytics consists of several stages. The first stage involves a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify the relevant factors that contribute to employee attrition. Once the driving factors are identified, the next stage involves designing graphs and charts using Power BI, which enables visualization of the data to gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns. Finally, the dashboard is designed dynamically to provide real-time insights into the driving factors that contribute to employee attrition. This workflow enables organizations to gain insights into the factors that influence employee attrition and take corrective action to optimize employee productivity and retention.
