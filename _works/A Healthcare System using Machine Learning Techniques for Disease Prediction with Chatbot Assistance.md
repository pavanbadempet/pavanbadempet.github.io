This project focuses on disease prediction, including liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease, through machine learning models implemented with XGBoost. Additionally, a healthcare chatbot is integrated to provide personalized health recommendations. The entire system is containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run for seamless scalability. Users also have the option to run the system locally.

Key Features:

* Disease Prediction: Utilizes XGBoost and Python ML libraries to predict prevalent diseases, addressing health challenges in the Indian population.

* Healthcare Chatbot: Integrates NLP and OpenAI API techniques for interactive and personalized health recommendations.

* Dockerized: The system is containerized for easy deployment and management.

* Cloud Deployment: Utilizes Google Cloud Run for scalable and available healthcare services.

* Local Deployment: Users can run the system locally for testing and development purposes.
